THIS STUDY COMPARED THE YIELD OF MICROBIAL GROWTH FROM ENDOSCOPES THAT HAD BEEN USED CLINICALLY BEFORE AND AFTER CLEANING WITH DIFFERENT BRUSH TYPES (BRISTLE, SQUEEGEE, AND HYBRID). ENDOSCOPES USED TO PERFORM A TOTAL OF 91 MEDICAL PROCEDURES ON 82 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. QUANTITATIVE BACTERIAL CULTURES. YIELDED NO STATISTICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT BRUSHES USED.

THE MOISTURE MUST HAVE BEEN TRANSMITTED FROM THE FIRST CABLE TO THE FIRST CATHETER, TO THE SECOND CABLE AND THE SECOND CATHETER. ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION WAS RECEIVED ON 11-MAR-2025. IT WAS REPORTED THAT SIGNAL INTERFERENCE WAS ON BOTH THE CARTO AND RECORDING SYSTEM. THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT HAVE ANY INTACT ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) SIGNAL AVAILABLE TO MONITOR PATIENT HEART RHYTHM. DURING THE SIGNAL INTERFERENCE, THE AFFECTED CATHETERS WERE INSIDE THE PATIENT�S BODY. SIGNAL NOISE WAS AN ISSUE ON BOTH STSF CATHETERS. AS SUCH, THE EVENT IS NOW CONSIDERED MDR REPORTABLE WITH AN AWARENESS DATE OF 11-MAR-2025. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ALSO INDICATED THAT THE PATIENT WAS DEEP SEDATED WITH LOCAL ANESTHESIA. NO INTERVENTION WAS REQUIRED THAT DAY. THE CORROSION WAS SEEN ON BOTH THE CABLES AND THE CATHETERS, AS THE FLUID TRANSFERRED DURING EACH CHANGE OF CABLES AND CATHETERS. Manufacturer Narrative: THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON MEDTECH (J&J MEDTECH) FOR EVALUATION. FOLLOWING J&J MEDTECH PROCEDURES, A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE RETURNED DEVICE WAS PERFORMED. VISUAL INSPECTION REVEALED CORROSION ON THE CONNECTOR PINS OF THE DEVICE. DEVICE WAS DISSECTED AND NO CORROSION WAS FOUND ON PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD (PCB). ADDITIONALLY, CONTINUITY WAS MEASURED FROM ELECTRICAL PCB AND NO ISSUES WERE FOUND. AN IRRIGATION TEST WAS PERFORMED AND NO WATER LEAKAGE THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A CORROSION WAS OBSERVED DURING THE ANALYSIS. A MANUFACTURING RECORD EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED FOR THE FINISHED DEVICE 31465000L NUMBER, AND NO INTERNAL ACTION RELATED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT CONDITION WERE IDENTIFIED. THE CORROSION OBSERVED IN THE CONNECTOR COULD BE RELATED TO THE CURRENT LEAKAGE ERROR, ELECTRICAL AND CONNECTOR ISSUES REPORTED BY THE CUSTOMER; THEREFORE, THE ISSUES REPORTED WERE CONFIRMED. THE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF CORROSION ON THE CONNECTOR COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. THE CARTO� 3 SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: DISCONNECT ALL CATHETER CABLES FROM THE PIU. IF THE ERROR PERSISTS AFTER DISCONNECTING ALL CATHETER CABLES FROM THE PIU, TURN OFF THE PIU POWER SUPPLY AND CONTACT BIOSENSE WEBSTER SERVICE AND SUPPORT DEPARTMENT TO REPORT A PIU ISSUE. IF THE ERROR MESSAGE DISAPPEARS AFTER DISCONNECTING ALL CATHETER CABLES, RECONNECT THE CATHETER CABLES, ONE BY ONE, UNTIL THE CATHETER OR CABLE CAUSING THE ERROR IS IDENTIFIED. REPLACE THE FAULTY CATHETER AND/OR CABLE. AS PART OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON MEDTECH'S QUALITY PROCESS, ALL DEVICES ARE MANUFACTURED, INSPECTED, AND RELEASED TO APPROVED SPECIFICATIONS. THIS REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF 21 CFR, PART 803.

THE MAX DIAMETER WAS 4.1MM AND THE NECK DIAMETER WAS 3.3MM. THE DISTAL LANDING ZONE WAS 3.23MM AND THE PROXIMAL LANDING ZONE WAS 5.07MM. VESSEL TORTOSITY WAS MODERATE. THE PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION DEVICE WAS SELECTED FOR USE BASED ON 3D MEASUREMENTS. HOWEVER, THE DISTAL SECTION OF THE DEVICE FAILED TO OPEN, AND THE TIP WAS FOUND TO BE DAMAGED. THE PED-475-20 MODEL WAS SELECTED BASED ON THE 3D MEASUREMENT. PHENOM27 SUCCESSFULLY REACHED THE IPSILATERAL MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY M1 UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF SYCHRO 0.014 INCHES, AND THEN THE STENT WAS OPENED, FULLY HYDRATED WITH HIGH-PRESSURE NORMAL SALINE, AND THEN DELIVERED IN PLACE. EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL AT THIS TIME. THE SURGEON INTENDED TO DEPLOY IT IN SITU, FIX THE STENT PUSH ROD, WITHDRAW THE STENT CATHETER PHENOM27, EXPOSE THE STENT TIP, BUT THE STENT DID NOT OPEN. THEN IT WAS CONTINUED TO DEPLOY MORE PED. AFTER DEPLOYED ABOUT 15MM, THE PROXIMAL END EXPANDED, BUT THE TIP OF THE STENT STILL DID NOT OPEN. IT HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO RETRIEVE PART OF THE STENT AND DEPLOY IT AGAIN. THIS TIME, IT WAS DEPLOYED FOR A LONGER DISTANCE, BUT THE TIP STILL COULD NOT OPEN. IT WAS PULLED A LITTLE BIT TOWARD THE PROXIMAL END AND SWUNG SLIGHTLY AS A WHOLE, BUT THE TIP OF THE STENT STILL COULD NOT OPEN. WAITING FOR REPEATED ADJUSTMENTS, BUT IT STILL COULD NOT OPEN. NON-SUBTRACTION ANGIOGRAPHY CONFIRMED THE TIP OF THE STENT, AND IT FELT THAT THE STATE WAS NOT NORMAL. IT HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO REMOVE THE STENT PED AND PHENOM27 FROM THE BODY AS A WHOLE AND FOUND THAT THE TIP HAD BEEN DAMAGED. THE DEVICE WAS RESAHETHED AND REMOVED WITH THE MICROCATHETER AND REPLACED WITH A TUBRIDGE STENT FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER, WHICH WAS SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED WITHOUT ISSUES. MORE THAN 50% OF THE DEVICE HAD BEEN DEPOLYED WHEN IT FAILED TO OPEN. THE PIPELINE WAS RESEHATHED LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO TWO TIMES. ADDITIONAL STEPS TAKEN TO OPEN THE PIPELINE INCLUDE DEPLOYING A LONGER DISTANCE, WAITING, SWINGING SLIGHTLY, RETRIEVING AND DEPLOYING AGAIN. THE DEVICES WERE PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU). THE PROCEDURE INVOLVED FEMORAL ARTERY ACCESS WITH A DIAMETER OF 6.5MM, AND THE PATIENT RECEIVED DUAL ANTIPLATELET TREATMENT WITH NORMAL PLATELET REACTIVITY LEVELS. ANGIOGRAPHIC RESULTS POST-PROCEDURE WERE NORMAL, AND NO PATIENT SYMPTOMS OR COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.

THE VASCULAR ACCESS ROUTE WAS MODERATELY TORTUOUS, AND DURING THE DEPLOYMENT PROCESS WHEN THE DISTAL END WAS NOT FULLY OPENED, THE SYSTEM SLIPPED AND HERNIATED INTO THE ANEURYSM. THE SURGEON ATTEMPTED TO REPOSITION THE SYSTEM FOR OVER 30 MINUTES BUT WAS UNABLE TO ADVANCE IT TO THE DISTAL END. CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS, THE SYSTEM WAS REMOVED. DURING THE STENT REPLACEMENT PROCESS, THE PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION DEVICE GOT STUCK AT THE PROXIMAL END OF THE PHENOM27 CATHETER, WHICH WAS KINKED AT THE PROXIMAL LOCATION. THE PHENOM27 WAS REPLACED, AND THE SYSTEM WAS SUCCESSFULLY REPOSITIONED FOR SURGERY. THERE WAS MODERATE FRICTION OF DIFFICULTY DURING DELIVERY OR POSITIONING. THE PIPELINE WAS NOT IMPLANTED. THE PIPELINE MISSED THE LANDING ZONE. THE DEVICE DID NOT JUMP DURING DEPLOYMENT. NO ADDITIONAL STEPS WERE TAKED TO SECURE THE DEVICE. THE PIPELINE WAS PLACED AT LEAST 3MM PAST THE ANEURYSM NECK ON EACH SIDE. NO SIDE BRANCHES WERE COVERED BY THE PIPELINE. THE TIP OF THE CATHETER MOVED DURING DEPLOYMENT. THE DEVICES WERE PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU). THE CATHETER WAS FLUSHED AS PER IFU. POSTOPERATIVE CONTRAST AGENT RETENTION WAS NOTED IN THE ANEURYSM. THE BASELINE ANEURYSM WAS UNRUPTURED AND SACCULAR. THE MAX DIAMETER WAS 18.98MM AND THE NECK DIAMETER WAS 8.98MM. THE DISTAL LANDING ZONE WAS 3.88MM AND THE PROXIMAL LANDING ZONE WAS 4.65MM.

THE VASCULAR ACCESS ROUTE WAS MODERATELY TORTUOUS, AND DURING THE DEPLOYMENT PROCESS�WHEN THE DISTAL END WAS NOT FULLY OPENED, THE SYSTEM SLIPPED AND HERNIATED INTO THE ANEURYSM. THE SURGEON ATTEMPTED TO REPOSITION THE SYSTEM FOR OVER 30 MINUTES BUT WAS UNABLE TO ADVANCE IT TO THE DISTAL END. CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS, THE SYSTEM WAS REMOVED. DURING THE STENT REPLACEMENT PROCESS, THE PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION DEVICE GOT STUCK AT THE PROXIMAL END OF THE PHENOM27 CATHETER, WHICH WAS KINKED AT THE PROXIMAL LOCATION. THE PHENOM27 WAS REPLACED, AND THE SYSTEM WAS SUCCESSFULLY REPOSITIONED FOR SURGERY. THERE WAS MODERATE FRICTION OF DIFFICULTY DURING DELIVERY OR POSITIONING. THE PIPELINE WAS NOT IMPLANTED. THE PIPELINE MISSED THE LANDING ZONE. THE DEVICE DID NOT JUMP DURING DEPLOYMENT. NO ADDITIONAL STEPS WERE TAKED TO SECURE THE DEVICE. THE PIPELINE WAS PLACED AT LEAST 3MM PAST THE ANEURSYM NECK ON EACH SIDE. NO SIDE BRANCHES WERE COVERED BY THE PIPELINE. THE TIP OF THE CATHETER MOVED DURING DEPLOYMENT. THE DEVICES WERE PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU). THE CATHETER WAS FLUSHED AS PER IFU. POSTOPERATIVE CONTRAST AGENT RETENTION WAS NOTED IN THE ANEURYSM. THE BASELINE ANEURYSM WAS UNRUPTURED AND SA CCULAR. THE MAX DIAMETER WAS 18.98MM AND THE NECK DIAMETER WAS 8.98MM. THE DISTAL LANDING ZONE WAS 3.88MM AND THE PROXIMAL LANDING ZONE WAS 4.65MM. VESSEL TORTOUSITY WAS MODERATE. DUAL ANTIPLATELET TREATMENT WAS ADMINISTERED, AND THE OPERATION WAS COMPLETED SUCCES SFULLY. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.

        "eventText": "Event Description: EVENT DESCRIPTION MANUFACTURER NARRATIVE(PROVIDED BY TELADOC) THE PATIENT REPORTED THAT THEIR DEVICE'S CUFF WOULD CONTINUE TO INFLATE TO THE POINT OF CAUSING BRUISING. TELADOC'S BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR FITS PATIENTS WITH UP TO A 42CM ARM CIRCUMFERENCE, THE PATIENT CONFIRMED THAT THEIR ARM IS WITHIN RANGE AS THEIR ARM IS NOT TOO SMALL OR TOO BIG. IT WAS NOT CONFIRMED IF THE PATIENT RECEIVED MEDICAL ATTENTION DUE TO THE BRUISING. EVENT DESCRIPTION THE DEVICE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT WAS NOT RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION. IF THE DEVICE IS RETURNED, AN INVESTIGATION WILL BE CONDUCTED AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED. Manufacturer Narrative: CAUSE: TRANSTEK COULDN'T GET BACK THE DEVICES CONCERNING THE CASE DIRECTLY. THERE ARE SOME SIMILAR DEVICE FAILURES FROM OTHER FEEDBACKS AND THE CAUSE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE THE SAME THEORETICALLY AS BELOW. 1. CHECK THE APPEARANCE OF THE DEVICE AND CUFF, THERE IS NO DEFECT FOUND. 2. TAKE A MEASUREMENT AND CHECK THE SOUND OF PUMP, THE RESULT IS NORMAL. 3. TEST THE STATIC PRESSURE TEST: THE DIFFERENCE OF MEASURE DISPLAY VALUE AND STANDARD VALUE IS LESS THAN 3 MMHG, THE PRESSURE VALUE OF EACH POINT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCURACY. 4. TEST AIR LEAKAGE TEST: THE AIR LEAKAGE VALUE IS LESS THAN 6MMHG, THE TEST IS PASSED. IT INDICATES THAT THE FUNCTION OF THE VALVE IS NORMAL. 5. REAL PERSON TEST: DURING MEASUREMENT PROCESS AND NO PAIN FELT. CONCLUSION: THE AIR PUMP AND CUFF IS WORKING FUNCTIONALLY, AND THE DEVICE INFLATION/DEFLATION FUNCTION IS NORMAL DURING THE TESTING. THE ANALYSIS RESULTS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED AND AGREED BY TELADOC, AND THIS PROBLEM IS RELATED TO USER PERCEPTION. THE BELOW MISOPERATION WILL LEAD TO INFLATION ISSUE WHICH IS INCLUDED IN USER MANUAL. THE CUSTOMER DIDN'T READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY. ACCORDING TO OUR EXPERIENCE, THE CAUSES OF PATIENT DISCOMFORT CAUSED BY INFLATION/DEFLATION ISSUE AS FOLLOWINGS: 1) DURING THE MEASUREMENT PROCESS, IF THE USER HAS BODY OR ARM SHAKING, TALKING, OR THE USER HAS PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE/ARRHYTHMIA, ETC., IT WILL INTERFERE WITH THE MEASUREMENT PROCESS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A RELIABLE MEASUREMENT, THE INFLATION PRESSURE VALUE OF THE DEVICE WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY INCREASED, AND THE PRESSURE ON THE ARM WILL BE MORE PRONOUNCED. 2) DURING THE MEASUREMENT PROCESS, IF THE USER WEARS THICKER CLOTHING, IT WILL INTERFERE WITH THE MEASUREMENT PROCESS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A RELIABLE MEASUREMENT, THE INFLATION PRESSURE VALUE OF THE DEVICE WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY INCREASED, AND THE PRESSURE ON THE ARM WILL BE MORE PRONOUNCED. 3) THE MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLE OF THE SPHYGMOMANOMETER REQUIRES THAT THE CUFF BLADDER BE INFLATED TO A CERTAIN VALUE HIGHER THAN THE SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE BEFORE THE MEASUREMENT CAN BE COMPLETED (THE CUFF AIR PRESSURE MUST BE HIGHER THAN THE SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE BY MORE THAN 30MMHG). IF THE USER HAS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (SUCH AS SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE 180MMHG, THE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF WILL INFLATE MORE THAN 210MMHG WHEN MEASURING BLOOD PRESSURE), UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PRESSURE FELT BY THE USER'S ARM WILL BE MORE THAN 30MMHG HIGHER THAN HIS/HER OWN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. CORRECTIVE ACTION: 1. ESTABLISH A REGULAR COMMUNICATION MECHANISM WITH CUSTOMERS 2. PREPARING A DOCUMENT CONCERNING TROUBLESHOOTING AND ESSENTIAL PRECAUTIONS AS A NOTIFICATION OF REMINDER FOR CUSTOMER PROMOTION TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF USER MISOPERATIONS.
